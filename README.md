# SQLite Pantry Inventory 

I was at an info session for melaluca software internship roles the other day, and one of the things 
they recommended for personal software projects was to fullfill the needs of a family member or friend via 
software. I asked my mom if there was an app she wished existed and she suggested a pantry management system 
that could scan barcodes to keep inventory of what she had at home. 

I have taken a SQL design class, but we never covered how to query from and update the database in a program. I 
began investigating SQLite and implemented this program. I hope to evolve this into a prototype mobile app at an upcoming HackUSU hackathon.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download from git hub
2. Load into IDE of your choice (I use VS code)
3. Ensure you have SQLite and python installed
3. Run program

Instructions for using the software:

1. The menu for the CLI is fairly self explanatory. Not much error handling has been implemented yet.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Ensure that you have the latest version of SQLlite installed. You can find the download here:
* [SQLite Download](https://sqlite.org/download.html)


## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [SQLite Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm)
* [Python SQLite Tutorial Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* Proper Error Handling. 
* Learn the proper way to implement test cases in python.
